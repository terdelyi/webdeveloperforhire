# webdeveloperforhire.co.uk

Hi, you're looking at the source code of my freelancer website. I'm a freelance software developer, specialised in
web-related services at [Web Developer For Hire](https://webdeveloperforhire.co.uk/). If you're looking for a
contractor, feel free to contact me.

## Development

The site is using an open-source static site generator of mine called
[Phanstatic](https://github.com/terdelyi/phanstatic/).

To be able to build the site locally you need PHP 8.1 and Node 20.

## Disclaimer

I absolutely don't mind if you get inspired, but please don't copy the design or the content of this site directly.
If you re-use the code or any elements, please drop me a DM, I would be happy to hear about it!

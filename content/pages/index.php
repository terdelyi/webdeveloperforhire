                    <div class="leading-relaxed has-paragraph text-black">
                        <p>My name is  <span title="pronounced as TAH-mahsh AIR-day-yee font-bold">Tamas Erdelyi</span>, and I'm a freelance software developer based in Gloucestershire, United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>I worked on hundreds of websites and web applications used by millions of visitors during my professional career. I was employed by various digital agencies and startups across different sectors, including marketing, fintech, prop-tech, and healthcare. I worked independently, as part of a team, and even led a teams of developers. I wrote the code of dozens single and multi-tenant web applications, scalable microservices, and I also created a modular CMS from scratch. I can set up and manage servers to host websites or web-applications, and I also have some experience in building and distributing mobile and desktop applications. I feel myself more confident on the backend, therefore I'm mainly, but not exclusively specialised to programming in PHP.</p>
                        <p>I'm passionate about refactoring, optimising and identifying bugs. Think of me as the electrician who fixes your broken TV instead of throwing it away. I'm not afraid to step outside my comfort zone, push the boundaries, and explore new languages, frameworks, libraries or platforms. I'm actively seeking out these opportunities.</p>
                        <p>As an employee, I've achieved nearly everything I aimed for in my career and decided to venture into new territories. Today, I offer my software development skills directly, working on my own products, creating courses, and mentoring less experienced programmers.</p>

                        <h3>Bring your ideas and leave the implementation to me</h3>
                        <p>In today's digital landscape, applications are everywhere – not just on your computer or phone, but even in your fridge. With years of experience crafting web applications, Content Management Systems (CMS), and various SaaS-type, subscription-based multi-tenant products, I specialise in building robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions.</p>
                        <p>I worked on several multiplatform applications built for Windows (.NET, WinForms), macOS (NW.js) or iPad (Swift) and I'm always eager to expand my expertise with new technologies.</p>
                        <p>I can help you build small or mid-sized applications, companions or command line utilities to support your existing or your brand-new product.</p>
                        <p>Have a new feature in mind? Show me what you need, and let's make it happen.</p>

                        <h3>Websites remain the top communication platform for most businesses</h3>
                        <p>A website serves as a vital gateway for businesses, enabling them to establish credibility, reach a wide audience, and facilitate customer engagement and transactions.</p>
                        <p>I'm here to transform your website design into a dynamic, user-friendly interface with a focus on minimizing your <span class="text-dark-green font-bold">carbon footprint</span>. Whether you need a simple, static website, a more complex dynamic site with the ability to upgrade your pages anytime or a multi-site with shared content, I've got you covered. Together, we'll tailor your most optimal database structure and select the best CMS to meet your needs.</p>
                        <p>Need a mobile friendly version of your site, a new plugin or feature into your CMS, offline version, dark mode, or fetching some data from external sources? I'm here to assist.</p>

                        <p>Whether you're integrating with other software or need to offer an interface for your partners, applications, or websites to update or access your data, it involves working with APIs.</p>
                        <p>After understanding your requirements, I can craft a detailed specification and develop a standard interface tailored to your needs.</p>
                        <p>Microservices break down large applications into smaller, independent services that each perform a specific function. This approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in building and managing complex software systems. With extensive experience in building, running, and monitoring microservices, I'm well-equipped to assist you.</p>

                        <h3>The idea of final software is wrong</h3>
                        <p>Just because you or your client paid once for developing an application or a website it doesn’t mean it stays future-proof forever. An obsolete stack with outdated third party libraries could be a huge risk for performance and security.</p>
                        <p>Technology evolves rapidly, therefore a frequent maintenance must be important part of a product's lifecycle - just as you would do it for your car or body every year.</p>
                        <p>I can review your PHP based website or web application, and make suggestions about what to upgrade or even get rid of any unnecessary third party packages to simplify your dependency chain.</p>

                    <div id="service-refactoring" class="hidden">
                        <h3>Simplicity over complexity</h3>
                        <p>When software developers frequently come and go or when your requirements change periodically, it's easy to end up with a messy codebase. Your application could contain hundreds of lines of unused code or overcomplicated logic which might slow down any extensions in the future or even the application's current performance.</p>
                        <p>The ghost in the machine is also just a phrase: that feeling in mainly caused by software bugs that occur due to mistakes, design failures, or untested edge cases. I can review your codebase, identify bottlenecks and provide recommendations on areas to improve.</p>
                        <p>Most database related issues can be tacked by normalising your schema, add proper indexes or simplify queries. I can also improve your test coverage which would make you more confident that things won't break when someone make changes the code next time.</p>

                    <div id="service-deployment" class="hidden">

                        <p>Distribution is one of the key parts of software development. When you lack of a proper deployment strategy or have performance issues with your current workflow, I might recommend you better options or alternative providers.</p>
                        <p>I can also improve your existing procedures, introducing pipelines with code quality checks and running tests before publishing your web application to the world.</p>

                        <p>During my career I helped multiple companies in different sizes to review their infrastructure and identify pain points. I can also offer code reviews for your team, set coding standards or regular progression checks.</p>

                        <p>Constant stress and firefighting can seriously affect developers' performance and mental health. Therefor companies usually hire more people to handle the growing amount of workload. However, the process of hiring new team members can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for temporary needs.</p>
                        <p>As an external contractor I can join your company for a fixed term, providing support to your colleagues to complete their tasks. This arrangement gives you the flexibility to assess whether permanent team expansion is necessary.</p>
